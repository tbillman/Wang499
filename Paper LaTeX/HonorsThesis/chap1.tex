Our research primarily focuses on using contemporary machine learning techniques to  predict mortgage values more accurately than traditional linear methods. Previous research has focused on classifying loans at time of origination as prepaid, paid as planned, or default. However, since banks are ultimately interested in making money as opposed to making sure everyone carries out their loan, there is still a large difference amongst the financial impact of loans within each of these categories. To remedy this, we compute the Net Present Value (NPV) of each loan which adjusts all payments to the time the loan was issued. This is a fairer way to compare the financial impact of loans compared to previous classification methods. Additionally, once we calculate NPVs we predict them using data collected before a loan is issued.
